# Introduction

Security bugs in the Linux kernel emerge endlessly and have attracted much attention. Previous research has found that fixing
security bugs in the Linux kernel could be incomplete and incorrect due to human mistakes. The former fails to repair all the original security
defects in the software, and the latter fails to properly repair the original security defects or introduces new ones. 

This repo contains the open data and tools for Linux kernel incorrect and incompelte security bug fixes.
